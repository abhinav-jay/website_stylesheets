# website_stylesheets
These are stylesheets meant to make website look better. You can use Stylus extension or any other css injection extension to copy-paste the stylehseet to a stylus stylesheet to use these stylesheets. They are mostly meant for desktop, not really for mobile, if you use mobile you may have to change the styles a bit. You might see lots of website for french high-schoolers because I am in high-school.
